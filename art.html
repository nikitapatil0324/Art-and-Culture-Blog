              <h2>The Beauty of Street Art</h2>
              <p>Street art is a fascinating form of visual art that often goes overlooked or even dismissed as graffiti. However, there are many talented artists who create beautiful, thought-provoking pieces of art in public spaces. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the beauty of street art and explore some of the best examples from around the world.</p>
              <img src="./picture/streeT ART.jpg" alt="Street Art">
              <p>Street art can take many forms, from large-scale murals to small, intricate designs. One of the things that makes street art so unique is its context. Unlike traditional gallery art, street art is often created in public spaces, which means that it interacts with its surroundings in interesting ways. For example, a mural might incorporate the architecture of a building or respond to a social or political issue in the local community.</p>
              <p>Another aspect of street art that makes it so compelling is its impermanence. Because it is often created illegally or without permission, street art can be painted over or removed at any time. This gives it a sense of urgency and immediacy that is rare in other forms of art.</p>
              <p>Despite its subversive nature, street art has gained a level of mainstream acceptance in recent years. Many cities now have dedicated street art tours or festivals, and some artists have even gained commercial success and critical acclaim.</p>
              <p>Whether you're a seasoned art lover or just starting to explore the world of visual art, street art is a fascinating and exciting genre that is well worth your attention.</p>
